Staying on a diet is tough. Only 20% of dieters stay on a regime after one month of starting. For folks in the ketogenic diet the problem is heightened by lack of options when choosing to eat out. A combination of a stringent regime and lack of readily available nutritional information on most restaurants spell disaster for the aspiring dieter. I developed an app, using menu information from local restaurants and nutritional information form mayor chain restaurants to locate meal options for ketogenic dieters at the click of a button. A hard task does not have to be impossible.

A user inputs their address and GoKeto finds close-by meal options suitable to the Ketogenic diet inferred from local restaurant and nutritional information databases.
